# docassemble.ALKilnInThePlayground

Run ALKiln automated tests on your server, no GitHub account required. Works for any docassemble Project. Made in collaboration with the SuffolkLITLab Document Assembly Line project, but it is unnecessary to install Assembly Line.

See guides for writing tests and more about the project at the [ALKiln documentation](https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/automated_integrated_testing).
